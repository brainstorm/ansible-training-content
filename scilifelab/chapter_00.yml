  title: Towards a SciFiLab for infrastructure
  description: Automate, automate, automate 

slides:
   -
     - h1: Towards a Sci-Fi-Lab
     - h3: Automate, automate, automate 

   -
     - h1: Sci-Life-Lab is quite awesome, but...
     - h3: Can we reach the SciFiLab?
     - class_notes: 
            Automation >>> Installation instructions.
            Documentation should contain minimal install insn.
            Why? Because we all want stable, auto-documented systems.
            How? With Configuration management tools that enforce idempotence:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence
            What? Ansible.
   -
     - h1: At the beggining, there was...

   -
     - h1: The Sci-Cry-Lab!
     - h4: What failed?
     - h4: There was a wonderful Swedish Summer around 2011... 
     - h4: and we were babysitting production systems :_(
     - ol: 
        - We had plenty of wiki documentation, not so good automation.
        - Debugging a distributed RabbitMQ bug on UPPMAX on interactive nodes... good luck with that!
        - Mis-use of python-kombu. Fixed. Documented. Forgotten.
        - Differing standards on how to package our python modules/apps.
     - class_notes: 
            Automation >>> Installation instructions.
            Documentation should contain minimal install insn.

   -
     - h1: Towards SciFiLab
     - ol:
        - Convert installation instructions into automated deployment (Automation >>> Installation instructions)
        - More "local" development using VMs.
        - Keep documentation in sync with reality, idempotent.
        - Monitor, analyze, control.

   - 
     - h1: But, wait... SciLifeLab is already doing so!
     - ol:
        - IT guys (Eric, Fredrik,...) use *puppet* regularly in the servers.
        - Guillermo created awesome Travis-CI deployment recipes during his thesis.
        - Valentine's StatusDB monitors and controls stuff.
        - We held some best practice sessions and courses on how to write python modules.
        - Isn't it enough?

   -
     - h1: NO.
     - class_notes: 
            Can you see the problems?

            Developers need to automate too, not only IT people.
            Application logs should be actionable, not only infra logs.

   -
     - h1: Best practices, for automation too
     - ol:
         - Document first, always (but keep in mind it is just poor man's automation).
         - Automate right after that, don't delay it!
         - Resist the manual ssh hotfixes temptation... if you can't, do it and then, write code.
         - Immediately couple your automation with minimum CI.
     - class_notes:
         Having integration testing (without tests), has value on its own! Otherwise a user will have to fix and go through the installation process again and again in the future.
